Here are 15 challenging questions based on the Kafka Security Overview document, designed to simulate real exam difficulty:

---

## Question 1

```markdown
Which of the following is NOT a core pillar of Kafka's security model?
```

**Options**
```markdown

- B. Authentication (SASL + SSL)
- C. Authorization (ACLs)
- D. Data compression (Snappy)
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** D

**Explanation:**

```markdown
The three core pillars of Kafka security are encryption (SSL/TLS), authentication (SASL + SSL), and authorization (ACLs). Data compression (Snappy) is unrelated to security.

```

**Options**
```markdown
- A. SASL/PLAIN
- B. SASL/SCRAM
- C. SASL/OAUTHBEARER
- D. SSL certificates
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**

```markdown
SASL/SCRAM uses salted passwords to enhance security, while SASL/PLAIN uses plaintext passwords, and SASL/OAUTHBEARER relies on tokens.

- A. Incorrect: SASL/PLAIN uses simple username/password without salting.
- B. Correct: SASL/SCRAM uses salted passwords.
- C. Incorrect: SASL/OAUTHBEARER uses token-based authentication.

## Question 3

```markdown
What is the primary purpose of SSL/TLS in Kafka?
```

**Options**
```markdown
- A. To authenticate clients using usernames and passwords

## Question 19

```markdown
What security protocol does Kafka use by default for communication between clients and brokers?
```

**Options**

```markdown
- A. SSL/TLS
- B. SASL_PLAINTEXT
- C. PLAINTEXT
- D. SASL_SSL
