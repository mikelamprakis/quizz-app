## Question 1

```markdown
What is the primary purpose of the `Connector` interface in Kafka Connect?  
```

- C. To validate configuration settings  
- D. To package the connector into a JAR  
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**

```markdown
The `Connector` interface defines the behavior of the connector and manages tasks, including specifying the task class and generating task configurations.  

- A. This is the role of the `Task` interface.  
- B. Correct. The `Connector` interface handles high-level connector behavior.

**Options**
```markdown  
- A. `maven-compiler-plugin`  
- B. `maven-shade-plugin`  
- C. `maven-surefire-plugin`  
- D. `maven-deploy-plugin`  
```  

<details><summary>Response:</summary>  

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**

```markdown  
The `maven-shade-plugin` packages the connector and its dependencies into a single JAR.  

- A. This plugin compiles code but does not bundle dependencies.  
- B. Correct. The `shade` plugin creates an uber-JAR.  
- C. This plugin runs tests, not packaging.  
- D. This plugin deploys artifacts but does not bundle dependencies.  
```

## Question 5

```markdown  
Where should you place the connector JAR for Kafka Connect to recognize it?  
```  

**Options**
```markdown  
- A. In the `bin` directory of Kafka  
- B. In the `plugin.path` directory  
- C. In the `config` directory  
- D. In the `logs` directory  
```  

<details><summary>Response:</summary>  

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**

```markdown  
The `plugin.path` directory is where Kafka Connect looks for connector JARs.  

- A. The `bin` directory contains scripts, not plugins.  
- B. Correct. `plugin.path` is the designated location.  
- C. The `config` directory stores configuration files.  
- D. The `logs` directory contains log files.  
```  

</details>

## Question 6

```markdown  
What is the purpose of the `MockConnect` framework?  
```  

**Options**
```markdown  
- A. To simulate a Kafka cluster for performance testing  
- B. To validate connectors without a full Kafka cluster  
- C. To package connectors into Docker images  
- D. To monitor connector metrics  
```  

<details><summary>Response:</summary>  

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**

```markdown  
`MockConnect` allows testing connectors in isolation without requiring a live Kafka cluster.  

- A. It is for functional testing, not performance.  
- B. Correct. It validates connectors in a mock environment.  
- C. Docker packaging is unrelated to `MockConnect`.  
- D. Metrics are handled by Kafka Connect's monitoring tools.  
```

## Question 7

```markdown  
Which method in the `Connector` interface determines how many tasks will be created?  
```  

**Options**
```markdown  
- A. `taskClass()`  
- B. `taskConfigs()`  
- C. `config()`  
- D. `start()`  
```  

<details><summary>Response:</summary>  

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**

```markdown  
`taskConfigs(int maxTasks)` generates configurations for each task, defining the parallelism.  

- A. `taskClass()` specifies the task implementation class.  
- B. Correct. `taskConfigs()` controls task count and configurations.  
- C. `config()` returns general connector settings.  
- D. `start()` initializes the connector but does not manage tasks.  
```

## Question 8

```markdown  
What is a best practice for sink connectors to avoid duplicate data writes?  
```  

**Options**
```markdown  
- A. Use incremental polling  
- B. Implement idempotent writes  
- C. Enable debug logging  
- D. Restart workers frequently  
```  

<details><summary>Response:</summary>  

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**

```markdown  
Idempotent writes ensure that duplicate operations do not result in duplicate data.  

- A. Incremental polling is for source connectors.  
- B. Correct. Idempotency prevents duplicates in sinks.  
- C. Debug logging helps troubleshoot but does not solve duplicates.  
- D. Restarting workers is not a solution for idempotency.

## Question 9

- B. Correct. `worker.properties` is for standalone worker configuration.  
- C. `config.properties` is not a standard Kafka Connect file.
