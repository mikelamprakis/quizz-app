## Question 0

How can you gracefully make a Kafka consumer to stop immediately polling data from Kafka and gracefully shut down a consumer application?

* A. Kill the consumer thread
* B. Call the consumer.poll() in another thread
* C. Call the consumer.wakeUp() and catch a WakeUpException

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:**
You should use `consumer.wakeUp()` to interrupt a long-running `poll()` call, and catch `WakeUpException` to close the consumer gracefully.

## Question 1

A consumer starts and has `auto.offset.reset=none`, and the topic partition currently has data for offsets going from 45 to 2311. The consumer group has committed the offset 10 for the topic before. Where will the consumer read from?

* A. Offset 10
* B. Offset 2311
* C. Offset 45
* D. It will crash

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** D

**Explanation:**
Since `auto.offset.reset=none`, and the committed offset (10) has been deleted (log start offset is now 45), the consumer will crash â€” it has no valid starting point.

## Question 2

A topic has three replicas and you set `min.insync.replicas=2`. If two out of three replicas are not available, what happens when a consume request is sent to broker?

* A. Data will be returned from the remaining in-sync replica
* B. An empty message will be returned
* C. A new leader of the partition will be elected

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** A

**Explanation:**
`min.insync.replicas` affects **producers** and controls write availability, not consumers. Consumers can still read from any available in-sync replica. So if only one replica is available and in-sync, the consumer will receive data from it.

## Question 3

When using the Confluent Kafka Distribution, where does the schema registry reside?

* A. As an in-memory plugin on Kafka broker
* B. As an in-memory plugin on Kafka Connect worker
* C. As a separate JVM component

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:**
The schema registry is a standalone REST service that runs as a separate JVM process, not embedded inside Kafka brokers or Kafka Connect workers.

## Question 4

What is returned by a `producer.send()` call in the Java API?

* A. A boolean
* B. Unit
* C. Future
* D. Future object

## Question 5

A Zookeeper ensemble contains 5 servers. What is the maximum number of servers that can go missing and the ensemble still run?

* A. 1
* B. 2
* C. 3
* D. 4

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**
Zookeeper requires a majority (quorum) to function. For 5 servers, quorum is 3, so up to 2 servers can fail and the ensemble will still work.

## Question 6

To allow consumers in a group to resume at the previously committed offset, I need to set the proper value for...

* A. value.deserializer
* B. enable.auto.commit
* C. group.id
* D. auto.offset.reset

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:**
Kafka tracks offsets per consumer group using the `group.id`. Without setting `group.id`, Kafka cannot associate committed offsets to the consumer group.
