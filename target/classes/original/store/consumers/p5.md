## Question 32

When a Kafka consumer wants to read data from a specific partition, what information does it need to provide to the Kafka broker?

* A. The topic name and the consumer group ID
* B. The topic name and the offset to start reading from
* C. The topic name, partition number, and offset to start reading from
* D. The topic name, partition number, and consumer group ID

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:**
To read from a specific partition, the consumer must specify the topic, partition number, and the offset. The group ID is only used in automatic assignment mode, not when reading a specific partition explicitly.

## Question 33

How does a Kafka consumer determine which broker to connect to when reading data from a specific partition?

* A. The consumer connects to any available broker and requests the leader for the specific partition
* B. The consumer connects to the Zookeeper ensemble to determine the leader for the specific partition
* C. The consumer uses a round-robin algorithm to select a broker to connect to
* D. The consumer connects to all brokers in the cluster simultaneously

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** A

**Explanation:**
The consumer sends a metadata request to any broker to get information about the topic and partition. This includes which broker is the leader for that partition. It then connects directly to the leader to fetch data.

## Question 34

What happens if a Kafka consumer requests to read from a partition that does not exist in the specified topic?

* A. The Kafka broker will automatically create the partition and start serving data
* B. The consumer will receive an empty response, indicating that the partition does not exist
* C. The consumer will receive an error message, indicating that the requested partition does not exist
* D. The consumer will be assigned a different, existing partition to read from

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:**
If a Kafka consumer tries to read from a non-existent partition, the broker responds with an error message such as `UNKNOWN_TOPIC_OR_PARTITION`. Kafka does **not** auto-create partitions in this scenario, nor does it reassign consumers to different partitions. The application must ensure that it references valid partitions when issuing read requests.

## Question 35

When a Kafka consumer commits offsets, what information is included in the commit request?

* A. The consumer group ID and the last processed offset for each partition
* B. The consumer group ID and the next offset to be processed for each partition
* C. The consumer ID and the last processed offset for each partition
* D. The consumer ID and the next offset to be processed for each partition

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** A

**Explanation:**
Offset commits in Kafka include the **consumer group ID** and the **last successfully processed offset** for each partition. This helps Kafka track the position of consumption per group. The consumer ID is not included in the commit data because offset tracking is done at the group level, not per individual consumer.

## Question 36

What happens if a Kafka consumer commits an offset for a partition and then crashes before processing the next message?

* A. The consumer will resume processing from the last committed offset when it restarts
* B. The consumer will resume processing from the next message after the last committed offset when it restarts
* C. The consumer will start processing from the beginning of the partition when it restarts
* D. The consumer will be assigned a different partition to process when it restarts

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** A

**Explanation:**
If a consumer crashes after committing an offset but before processing the next message, it will resume **from the last committed offset**. This may result in reprocessing the same message, but it ensures no data loss. It's a trade-off between **at-least-once** delivery and performance.

## Question 37

What is the purpose of the `enable.auto.commit` configuration property in Kafka consumers?

* A. To automatically commit offsets at a fixed interval
* B. To automatically commit offsets after each message is processed
* C. To enable or disable automatic offset commits
* D. To specify the maximum number of offsets to commit in a single request

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:**
The `enable.auto.commit` property **controls whether offset commits are automatic**. When `true`, offsets are committed periodically based on the `auto.commit.interval.ms` setting. When `false`, the application must commit offsets manually using `commitSync()` or `commitAsync()`.

## Question 38

In a topic with a replication factor of 3 and `min.insync.replicas` set to 2, what happens when a consumer sends a read request to a partition with only one in-sync replica?

* A. The consumer receives the requested data from the in-sync replica
* B. The consumer request fails with a `NotEnoughReplicasException`
* C. The consumer receives an empty response
* D. The consumer request remains pending until another replica becomes in-sync

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** A

**Explanation:**
The `min.insync.replicas` setting applies only to **write operations**, not reads. A consumer can read from any in-sync replica, even if only one remains. So, even with just one ISR, the consumer will still receive the requested data.
