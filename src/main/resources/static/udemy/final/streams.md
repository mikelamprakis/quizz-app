When building a Kafka Streams application to compute running totals from incoming sales data, which Kafka Streams operations are essential?

(Select all that apply)

Your selection is correct
reduce

mapValues

Your selection is incorrect
windowedBy

Your selection is correct
groupBy

Overall explanation
For computing running totals in a stateful manner, it's crucial to use groupBy to organize the records by a specific key that defines how the data should be accumulated (e.g., by customer ID or product ID). Following this grouping, a reduce operation is used to perform the actual aggregation, summing up the values continuously as new data comes in. This setup is vital for maintaining an updated state of running totals within the Kafka Streams application​​.

Is the join operation in Kafka stateful?

No, the join operation in Kafka is stateless and does not require maintaining any state information.

Your answer is incorrect
Yes, the join operation in Kafka is stateful, but it does not support combining data across different time windows or key matches.

Correct answer
Yes, the join operation in Kafka is stateful, requiring state information about the streams or tables being joined.

No, the join operation in Kafka is handled by an external database, which maintains the necessary state.

Overall explanation
Yes, the join operation in Kafka is stateful. It requires maintaining state information about the streams or tables being joined to handle the combination of data across different time windows or key matches.

You are designing a Kafka Streams application to process data from a topic with 10 partitions. How will the number of tasks be determined in your application, and what is the significance of this configuration?

Correct answer
The number of tasks will be equal to the number of partitions in the source topic, with each task processing messages from exactly one partition.

The number of tasks will be set manually in the application configuration to control parallelism.

The number of tasks will be dynamically adjusted based on the workload, optimizing resource utilization.

Your answer is incorrect
The number of tasks will be equal to the number of consumers in the consumer group, ensuring balanced processing.

Overall explanation
In Kafka Streams, the number of tasks is directly equal to the number of partitions in the source topic. This one-to-one mapping ensures that each task processes messages from exactly one partition, optimizing parallel processing and enhancing overall application scalability and performance. Therefore, with a topic of 10 partitions, there will be 10 tasks in the Kafka Streams application.
