## Question 43

What happens when `max.in.flight.requests.per.connection` is set to 1 and `enable.idempotence` is set to true in the Kafka producer configuration?

* A. The producer will send messages in batches to improve throughput
* B. The producer will wait for each request to be acknowledged before sending the next request
* C. The producer will retry failed requests automatically
* D. The producer will disable message compression

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**
With `max.in.flight.requests.per.connection=1` and `enable.idempotence=true`, the producer sends one message at a time per connection and waits for acknowledgment before proceeding. This guarantees strict ordering and exactly-once delivery but may reduce throughput.

## Question 44

How does enabling idempotence affect the performance of the Kafka producer?

* A. It significantly improves the producer's throughput
* B. It has no impact on the producer's performance
* C. It may slightly reduce the producer's throughput
* D. It increases the producer's memory usage

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:**
Enabling idempotence adds overhead due to extra metadata and tracking per message to ensure exactly-once delivery. While the performance impact is small, throughput may be slightly reduced compared to a non-idempotent producer.

## Question 45

What does the `acks=all` setting in the Kafka producer configuration ensure?

* A. The producer will receive an acknowledgment only after the message is written to all replicas
* B. The producer will receive an acknowledgment only after the message is written to the leader replica
* C. The producer will receive an acknowledgment only after the message is written to all in-sync replicas
* D. The producer will not wait for any acknowledgment and will consider the write successful immediately

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:**
Setting `acks=all` ensures that a message is acknowledged only after all in-sync replicas (ISRs) have persisted it. This setting provides the highest durability guarantee but may introduce additional latency.

## Question 46

What is the purpose of the `client.id` setting in the Kafka producer and consumer configurations?

* A. To specify a unique identifier for the client within a Kafka cluster
* B. To set the maximum number of requests the client can send or receive
* C. To determine the compression type used for message production or consumption
* D. To control the maximum amount of memory the client can use for buffering

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** A

**Explanation:**
The `client.id` helps uniquely identify clients in logs and metrics. It is useful for monitoring and debugging but has no impact on message delivery, memory usage, or compression.

## Question 47

What happens if multiple Kafka clients use the same `client.id` value?

* A. The clients will share the same configuration and connection pooling
* B. The clients will be treated as a single logical client by the Kafka brokers
* C. The behavior is undefined, and it may lead to unexpected results or errors
* D. The Kafka brokers will reject the connection attempts from clients with duplicate `client.id`

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:**
Using the same `client.id` across multiple clients can cause confusion in monitoring and metrics. Kafka does not enforce uniqueness, and while it won’t reject connections, it may lead to misattributed logs or unpredictable behavior.

## Question 48

If a producer sends a message with a key to a topic with 5 partitions, which partition will the message be written to?

* A. The partition is randomly selected
* B. The partition is determined based on the hash of the message key
* C. The partition is always the first partition (partition 0)
* D. The partition is determined by the broker

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**
When a message has a key, the Kafka producer uses the murmur2 hash of the key to determine the partition. This ensures that messages with the same key are routed to the same partition, preserving order.

</details>

## Question 49

What happens if a producer sends a message without a key to a topic with 3 partitions?

* A. The message is discarded
* B. The message is sent to a randomly selected partition
* C. The message is sent to all partitions
* D. The message is sent to the partition with the least amount of data

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**
When a producer sends a message without a key to a topic, Kafka’s default partitioner uses a round-robin approach to distribute messages across all available partitions. This ensures even distribution. The message is not discarded, not sent to all partitions, and not sent to the least-used partition—Kafka doesn’t analyze partition load for routing decisions.
