## Question 1
>
**What is returned by a `producer.send()` call in the Java API?**

1. String
2. Boolean
3. RecordMetadata
4. Future\<RecordMetadata> object

<details>
<summary>Answer: 4. Future&lt;RecordMetadata&gt; object</summary>

Kafka's `send()` method returns a `Future<RecordMetadata>` object. This allows the producer to send messages asynchronously and optionally wait for the result using `.get()`.

This Future completes once the broker acknowledges the record.

## Question 2
>
**The rule "same key goes to the same partition" is true unless...**

1. Replication factor changes
2. Number of partitions changes
3. Number of producers changes
4. Compression is enabled

<details>
<summary>Answer: 2. Number of partitions changes</summary>

Kafka partitions are determined by hashing the key and taking a modulo with the number of partitions. If the number of partitions changes, the same key may end up in a different partition.

Replication factor or number of producers does not affect this behavior.

## Question 3
>
**When is the `onCompletion()` method called in a Producer Callback?**

```java
private class ProducerCallback implements Callback {
    @Override
    public void onCompletion(RecordMetadata metadata, Exception e) {
        if (e != null) e.printStackTrace();
    }
}
```

1. Immediately after serialization
2. Immediately when `send()` is called
3. When the broker response is received
4. Only on failure

<details>
<summary>Answer: 3. When the broker response is received</summary>

The `onCompletion()` method is called when Kafka receives a response from the broker, whether successful or an error occurred. It is not called immediately after calling `send()` or during serialization.

</details>

---

## Question 4

**To prevent network-induced duplicates when producing to Kafka, I should use:**

1. acks=0
2. batch.size=0
3. enable.idempotence=true
4. retries=0

<details>
<summary>Answer: 3. enable.idempotence=true</summary>

Idempotent producers prevent duplicate writes even if the producer retries due to network errors or broker failures. This guarantees **at-least-once semantics without duplication**.

Simply setting retries without idempotence may still cause duplicate messages.

</details>

---

## Question 5

**Where will a message with no key be stored?**

1. The first partition of the topic
2. A random topic partition
3. Any of the topic partitions using round-robin
4. The partition with least messages

<details>
<summary>Answer: 3. Any of the topic partitions using round-robin</summary>

When a message has no key, the Kafka producer uses a round-robin algorithm to spread messages evenly across all partitions in the topic.

</details>

---

## Question 6
>
**A Kafka topic has a replication factor of 3 and `min.insync.replicas=2`. How many brokers can go down before a producer with `acks=all` can't produce?**

1. One broker
2. Two brokers
3. All brokers can go down
4. None

<details>
<summary>Answer: 1. One broker</summary>

With `acks=all`, the producer waits for acknowledgment from all in-sync replicas. `min.insync.replicas=2` requires at least two replicas to acknowledge the write.

If more than one broker goes down, only one replica is left, and the write fails.

</details>

## Question 1

What happens when you set `max.in.flight.requests.per.connection` to a value greater than 1 in a Kafka producer?

- A. It increases the throughput of the producer
- B. It increases the latency of the producer
- C. It can lead to out-of-order delivery of messages
- D. It has no effect on the producer's behavior

<details>
<summary>Response:</summary> 

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:**
Setting `max.in.flight.requests.per.connection` to a value greater than 1 in a Kafka producer allows multiple requests to be sent to the broker in parallel, without waiting for the previous requests to be acknowledged. While this can improve throughput, it also means that if a request fails and needs to be retried, the subsequent requests may have already been processed, leading to out-of-order delivery.

- A is incorrect because while it can improve throughput, it's not the only effect.
- B is incorrect. In fact, it can potentially decrease latency by allowing more requests in flight.
- D is incorrect because it does have a significant effect on the producer's behavior.

</details>

## Question 2

What is the effect of setting `acks=0` in a Kafka producer?

- A. The producer will wait for the broker to acknowledge the message before sending the next one
- B. The producer will wait for the leader and all replicas to acknowledge the message
- C. The producer will not wait for any acknowledgement from the broker
- D. The producer will throw an exception if the broker does not acknowledge the message

<details>
<summary>Response:</summary> 

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:**
When `acks` is set to 0 in a Kafka producer, the producer will not wait for any acknowledgement from the broker before considering the send operation successful. This means the producer will fire and forget the message, providing no guarantees about whether the broker has received it.

- A and B are incorrect because they describe the behaviors of `acks=1` and `acks=all` respectively.
- D is incorrect because no exception is thrown in this case. The producer simply continues sending messages without waiting for acknowledgement.

</details>

## Question 3
>
What is the relationship between `request.timeout.ms` and `delivery.timeout.ms` in a Kafka producer?

- A. `request.timeout.ms` should always be greater than `delivery.timeout.ms`
- B. `delivery.timeout.ms` should always be greater than `request.timeout.ms`
- C. They should always be set to the same value
- D. They are independent and can be set to any value

<details>
<summary>Response:</summary> 

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**
In a Kafka producer, `request.timeout.ms` configures the maximum amount of time the client will wait for a response from the server when sending a request, while `delivery.timeout.ms` sets an upper bound on the time to report success or failure to the application after a call to `send()`.

If `delivery.timeout.ms` is smaller than `request.timeout.ms`, the client can time out and report a failure to the application before the request timeout even occurs. Therefore, `delivery.timeout.ms` should always be greater than `request.timeout.ms` to allow the full request timeout to elapse before reporting a timeout failure to the application.

- A is incorrect because it's the other way around.
- C is incorrect because they serve different purposes and can have different values.
- D is incorrect because there is a recommended relationship between the two settings.

</details>

## Question 4

A Kafka producer application needs to send messages to a topic. The messages do not require any particular order. Which of the following properties are mandatory in the producer configuration? (Select two)

- A. `compression.type`
- B. `partitioner.class`
- C. `bootstrap.servers`
- D. `key.serializer`
- E. `value.serializer`
- F. `client.id`

<details>
<summary>Response:</summary> 

**Answer:** C, E

**Explanation:**
For a Kafka producer application to function, it must know how to connect to the Kafka cluster and how to serialize the message values. Therefore, the mandatory properties are:

- `bootstrap.servers`: This specifies the list of Kafka brokers the producer should contact to bootstrap initial cluster metadata.
- `value.serializer`: This specifies the serializer class for message values.

The other options are not strictly mandatory:

- A: `compression.type` is optional. If not set, the producer will send uncompressed messages.
- B: `partitioner.class` is optional. If not set, the default partitioner will be used, which is sufficient for messages that don't require a particular order.
- D: `key.serializer` is only required if the messages have keys. It's not mandatory if the messages don't have keys.
- F: `client.id` is optional. It's used to identify the producer application, but the producer will work without it.

</details>

## Question 5
>
What is the purpose of setting `compression.type` in a Kafka producer configuration?

- A. To specify the compression algorithm used when sending data to Kafka
- B. To specify the compression algorithm used when storing data on Kafka brokers
- C. To enable or disable compression for the producer
- D. To set the compression level for the producer

<details>
<summary>Response:</summary> 

**Answer:** A

**Explanation:**
The `compression.type` setting in a Kafka producer configuration is used to specify the compression algorithm that the producer will use when sending data to Kafka. The available options are:

- `none`: No compression (default)
- `gzip`: GZIP compression
- `snappy`: Snappy compression
- `lz4`: LZ4 compression
- `zstd`: ZStandard compression

The compression is applied by the producer before sending the data, and the broker will store the compressed data as is. The consumer will decompress the data when it receives it.

- B is incorrect because the broker does not perform compression, it just stores what it receives.
- C is incorrect because `compression.type` does not enable/disable compression, it specifies the algorithm. Compression is enabled by default if an algorithm is specified.
- D is incorrect because `compression.type` sets the algorithm, not the compression level. Some compression types (like `zstd`) have separate settings for compression level.

</details>

## Question 6
>
What is the effect of enabling compression on the producer side in Kafka?

- A. Reduced producer memory usage
- B. Increased consumer CPU usage
- C. Reduced network bandwidth usage
- D. Increased end-to-end latency

<details>
<summary>Response:</summary> 

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:**
Enabling compression on the producer side in Kafka can significantly reduce the amount of network bandwidth used when sending data from the producer to the Kafka brokers. The compressed data takes up less space on the wire, thus reducing network I/O.

However, there are trade-offs:

- A is incorrect because compression actually increases memory usage on the producer side, as the data needs to be held in memory during the compression process.
- B is correct because the consumer will need to use CPU cycles to decompress the data when it receives it.
- D is correct because compression and decompression add some processing time, slightly increasing the end-to-end latency.

So enabling producer compression is a trade-off between network bandwidth and CPU/memory usage. It's most beneficial when network bandwidth is the bottleneck.

</details>

## Question 7

What is the relationship between `batch.size` and `linger.ms` in the Kafka producer configuration?

- A. They are mutually exclusive settings
- B. `linger.ms` is only relevant if `batch.size` is set to 0
- C. `batch.size` is only relevant if `linger.ms` is set to 0
- D. They work together to control when a batch is considered ready to send

<details>
<summary>Response:</summary> 

**Answer:** D

**Explanation:**
In the Kafka producer, `batch.size` and `linger.ms` work together to control when a batch of messages is considered ready to send to the broker:

- `batch.size` sets the maximum amount of data that will be included in a single batch.
- `linger.ms` sets the maximum amount of time a batch will wait before being sent to the broker.

A batch will be sent when either `batch.size` is reached or `linger.ms` has passed, whichever comes first.

- A is incorrect because the settings are not mutually exclusive, they work together.
- B and C are incorrect because both settings are always relevant, regardless of the value of the other setting. If `batch.size` is 0, batching is effectively disabled. If `linger.ms` is 0, the producer will not wait at all and will send batches as soon as they are ready.

Tuning these settings can have a significant impact on producer performance and throughput.

</details>

## Question 8

What is the effect of increasing `batch.size` in a Kafka producer configuration?

- A. It increases the maximum size of each individual message
- B. It increases the maximum number of messages that can be sent in a single request
- C. It increases the maximum time a batch will wait before being sent
- D. It increases the maximum amount of memory the producer will use for buffering

<details>
<summary>Response:</summary> 

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**
In a Kafka producer, the `batch.size` setting controls the maximum number of bytes that will be sent in a single request to the broker. By increasing `batch.size`, you allow the producer to pack more messages into each request, which can improve throughput by reducing the overhead of making many smaller requests.

However, there are trade-offs to consider:

- A larger `batch.size` means the producer will buffer more data in memory before sending, which can increase memory usage (D).
- A larger `batch.size` can also increase the latency of message sends, as the producer may wait longer for a batch to fill up before sending.

It's important to note that `batch.size` does not affect the size of individual messages (A), only how many messages can be batched together in a single request. The maximum individual message size is controlled by a separate `max.request.size` setting.

Also, `batch.size` does not directly control the time a batch will wait (C). That is controlled by the `linger.ms` setting.

</details>

## Question 9
>
What is the relationship between `linger.ms` and `request.timeout.ms` in the Kafka producer configuration?

- A. They are redundant settings that control the same thing
- B. `linger.ms` should always be set higher than `request.timeout.ms`
- C. `request.timeout.ms` should always be set higher than `linger.ms`
- D. They control independent aspects of the producer behavior

<details>
<summary>Response:</summary> 

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:**
While `linger.ms` and `request.timeout.ms` both relate to the timing of when the Kafka producer sends data, they control different aspects and their values should be coordinated:

- `linger.ms` controls the maximum amount of time a batch will wait before being sent to the broker. A higher value can increase batching and thus throughput, at the cost of some latency.
- `request.timeout.ms` controls the maximum amount of time the producer will wait for a response from the broker before considering the request failed.

It's important that `request.timeout.ms` is set higher than `linger.ms`. If `request.timeout.ms` is lower, the producer might timeout a request before the `linger.ms` period is over, leading to failed sends and potential data loss.

A good rule of thumb is to set `request.timeout.ms` to be at least a few seconds higher than `linger.ms`, to account for potential network or broker latencies on top of the expected linger time.

- A is incorrect because the settings control different things.
- B is incorrect because it's the other way around.
- D is incorrect because while the settings do control independent things, their values should be coordinated.

</details>

## Question 10

What happens if `linger.ms` is set to 0 in the Kafka producer configuration?

- A. The producer will never send any messages
- B. The producer will wait indefinitely for each batch to fill up before sending
- C. The producer will send each message as soon as it is received, without batching
- D. The producer will use the default linger time

<details>
<summary>Response:</summary> 

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:**
Setting `linger.ms` to 0 in the Kafka producer configuration means that the producer will not wait at all before sending a batch of messages. In effect, this disables batching: each message will be sent to the broker as soon as it is received by the producer.

This can be useful in scenarios where minimizing latency is more important than maximizing throughput. With `linger.ms=0`, each message is sent immediately, minimizing the time between when a message is produced and when it is available to be consumed.

However, disabling batching can significantly reduce throughput, as the producer will make many more requests to the broker, each carrying fewer messages. This increases the overhead of the request-response cycle.

In most cases, it's recommended to set `linger.ms` to a small but non-zero value, like 5-100ms, to strike a balance between latency and throughput.

- A is incorrect because a linger time of 0 does not prevent the producer from sending messages, it just sends them immediately.
- B is incorrect because a linger time of 0 means the producer won't wait at all, not that it will wait indefinitely.
- D is incorrect because 0 is a valid setting for `linger.ms`, not a signal to use the default.

</details>

## Question 11

In the Kafka producer API, what is the purpose of the `acks` configuration parameter?
>
- A. To specify the number of acknowledgments the producer requires the leader to have received before considering a request complete
- B. To specify the number of replicas that must acknowledge a write for the write to be considered successful
- C. To specify the number of times the producer will retry a failed request
- D. To specify the number of partitions a topic must have for the producer to send messages to it

<details>
<summary>Response:</summary> 

**Answer:** A

**Explanation:**
The `acks` parameter in the Kafka producer API controls the durability of writes from the producer to the Kafka broker. It specifies the number of acknowledgments the producer requires the leader to have received before considering a request complete.

The valid values for `acks` are:

- 0: The producer will not wait for any acknowledgment from the server at all. The message will be immediately added to the socket buffer and considered sent.
- 1: The leader will write the record to its local log and respond without awaiting full acknowledgement from all followers.
- all: The leader will wait for the full set of in-sync replicas to acknowledge the record before responding to the producer.

The higher the `acks` value, the stronger the durability guarantee, but also the slower the write performance.

- B is incorrect because `acks` is about acknowledgments from the leader, not the number of replicas that must acknowledge.
- C is incorrect because `acks` is not related to the number of retries.
- D is incorrect because `acks` is not related to the number of partitions in a topic.

</details>

## Question 12
>
How does the `min.insync.replicas` broker configuration interact with the `acks` producer configuration?

- A. They are completely independent settings
- B. `acks` must always be set to `all` for `min.insync.replicas` to have any effect
- C. `min.insync.replicas` is only relevant if `acks` is set to `1` or `all`
- D. If `acks` is set to `all`, writes will only succeed if the number of in-sync replicas is at least `min.insync.replicas`

<details>
<summary>Response:</summary> 

**Answer:** D

**Explanation:**
The `min.insync.replicas` broker configuration and the `acks` producer configuration work together to control the durability of writes in Kafka:

- `min.insync.replicas` specifies the minimum number of replicas that must acknowledge a write for the write to be considered successful.
- `acks` specifies the number of acknowledgments the producer requires the leader to have received before considering a request complete.

When `acks` is set to `all`, the leader will wait for the full set of in-sync replicas to acknowledge the write before responding to the producer. However, if the number of in-sync replicas is less than `min.insync.replicas`, the write will fail even if `acks=all`.

This ensures that a minimum number of replicas have the data, providing a stronger durability guarantee.

- A is incorrect because the settings are not independent, they interact.
- B is incorrect because `min.insync.replicas` can have an effect even if `acks` is not `all`.
- C is incorrect because `min.insync.replicas` is not directly relevant to `acks=1`, only to `acks=all`.

</details>

## Question 13
>
What happens if a Kafka producer sends a message with `acks=all` to a topic partition with 3 replicas, but only 2 replicas are currently in-sync?

- A. The write will succeed and the producer will receive an acknowledgment
- B. The write will succeed but the producer will not receive an acknowledgment
- C. The write will be queued until the third replica comes back in-sync
- D. The write will fail and the producer will receive an error

<details>
<summary>Response:</summary> 

**Answer:** D

**Explanation:**
In this scenario, the producer is configured with `acks=all`, meaning it requires an acknowledgment from all in-sync replicas before considering a write successful. The topic partition has 3 replicas configured, but only 2 are currently in-sync.

When the producer sends a message to this partition, the leader will attempt to replicate the write to all in-sync replicas. However, since the number of in-sync replicas (2) is less than the total number of replicas (3), the leader will not receive acknowledgments from all replicas.

- A. a result, the write will fail and the producer will receive an error (a `NotEnoughReplicasException`). The message will not be written to the Kafka log.

This behavior protects against data loss by ensuring that writes are only considered successful if they have been durably written to the full set of in-sync replicas.

- A and B are incorrect because the write will not succeed in this scenario.
- C is incorrect because the write will not be queued, it will fail immediately.

</details>

## Question 14
>CHECK AGAIN

Can a producer configured with `acks=all` and `retries=Integer.MAX_VALUE` ever experience data loss?

- A. No, this configuration guarantees no data loss under all circumstances
- B. Yes, if the total number of replicas for a partition drops below `min.insync.replicas`
- C. Yes, if `unclean.leader.election.enable=true` and all in-sync replicas fail
- D. Yes, if the producer crashes after the broker acknowledges the write but before the producer records the acknowledgment

<details>
<summary>Response:</summary> 

**Answer:** B, C, D

**Explanation:**
While a producer configured with `acks=all` and `retries=Integer.MAX_VALUE` provides a very strong durability guarantee, there are still some edge cases where data loss can occur:

1. If the number of in-sync replicas for a partition drops below `min.insync.replicas`, the broker will start rejecting writes to that partition. If this happens, and the producer exhausts its retries, the write will fail and the data will be lost. This can happen if replicas crash or become unavailable.

2. If `unclean.leader.election.enable=true` and all in-sync replicas for a partition fail, an out-of-sync replica can be elected as the new leader. This replica may be missing some of the latest messages, causing data loss.

3. If the producer crashes (or loses connectivity) after the broker acknowledges a write but before the producer records the acknowledgment, the producer will treat the write as failed and may retry it. This can lead to duplicate messages, but from the perspective of the crashed producer instance, the original message is lost.

So while `acks=all` and `retries=Integer.MAX_VALUE` provide a very strong durability guarantee, they cannot completely eliminate the possibility of data loss in all failure scenarios.

- A is incorrect because, as explained above, there are edge cases where data loss can still occur even with this configuration.

</details>

## Question 15

You want to produce messages to a Kafka topic using a Java client. Which of the following is NOT a required configuration for the producer?

- A. `bootstrap.servers`
- B. `key.serializer`
- C. `value.serializer`
- D. `partitioner.class`

<details>
<summary>Response:</summary> 

**Answer:** D

**Explanation:**
When creating a Kafka producer in Java, there are several required configurations:

- `bootstrap.servers`: This specifies the list of broker addresses the producer should contact to bootstrap initial cluster metadata. It is required for the producer to know where to send requests.
- `key.serializer`: This specifies the serializer class for keys. It is required because Kafka needs to know how to serialize the key object to bytes.
- `value.serializer`: This specifies the serializer class for values. It is required because Kafka needs to know how to serialize the value object to bytes.

The `partitioner.class` configuration is optional. It specifies the partitioner class that should be used to determine which partition to send each message to. If not specified, the default partitioner will be used, which is sufficient for most use cases.

</details>

## Question 16
>
Which of the following is true about the relationship between producers and consumers in Kafka?

- A. Producers and consumers must use the same serialization format
- B. Producers and consumers must be written in the same programming language
- C. Producers and consumers are decoupled by the Kafka topic
- D. Producers must know about the consumers to send messages to them

<details>
<summary>Response:</summary> 

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:**
One of the key design principles of Kafka is the decoupling of producers and consumers:

- Producers write messages to a Kafka topic, without needing to know about the consumers that will read those messages.
- Consumers read messages from a Kafka topic, without needing to know about the producers that wrote those messages.

This decoupling is achieved through the Kafka topic, which acts as a buffer between producers and consumers. Producers write to the topic and consumers read from the topic, but they don't need to be aware of each other.

This decoupling allows for several benefits:

- Producers and consumers can be scaled independently, as they are not directly dependent on each other.
- Producers and consumers can be written in different programming languages and use different serialization formats, as long as they agree on the data format of the messages in the topic.
- New consumers can be added to read from the topic without affecting the producers.

Therefore, statements A, B, and D are incorrect. Producers and consumers do not need to use the same serialization format, be written in the same language, or know about each other. They are decoupled by the Kafka topic.

</details>

## Question 17

What happens if a Kafka producer sends a message to a topic partition and does not receive an acknowledgment from the broker?

- A. The producer will consider the message as successfully sent
- B. The producer will wait indefinitely for the acknowledgment
- C. The producer will retry sending the message based on its retry configuration
- D. The producer will immediately send the next message in the queue

<details>
<summary>Response:</summary> 

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:**
When a Kafka producer sends a message, it waits for an acknowledgment from the broker before considering the send operation complete. If the acknowledgment is not received within the configured `request.timeout.ms`, the send operation is considered failed.

In case of a failure, the producer's behavior depends on its `retries` configuration:

- If `retries` is set to 0, the producer will not retry the send operation. It will consider the message as failed and will either throw an exception or invoke the callback function with an error, depending on how the send operation was invoked.
- If `retries` is set to a value greater than 0, the producer will retry sending the message up to the specified number of times. It will wait for `retry.backoff.ms` before each retry attempt.

If the producer exhausts all retry attempts without receiving an acknowledgment, it will consider the message as failed.

Therefore, statement C is correct. The producer will retry sending the message based on its retry configuration.

- A is incorrect because the producer will not consider the message as successfully sent until it receives an acknowledgment.
- B is incorrect because the producer will not wait indefinitely. It will timeout after `request.timeout.ms`.
- D is incorrect because the producer will not immediately send the next message. It will attempt to retry the failed message first.

</details>

## Question 18

What is the purpose of the `acks` parameter in Kafka producer configuration?

- A. To specify the number of partitions the producer should write to
- B. To specify the number of replicas that must acknowledge a write for it to be considered successful
- C. To specify the number of times the producer should retry sending a message
- D. To specify the maximum size of a batch of messages

<details>
<summary>Response:</summary> 

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**
The `acks` parameter in Kafka producer configuration is used to specify the number of acknowledgments the producer requires the leader to have received before considering a write request complete. It controls the durability and reliability of message writes.

The `acks` parameter can have the following values:

- `0`: The producer does not wait for any acknowledgment from the server. The message is considered sent as soon as it is written to the network. This provides the lowest latency but also the lowest durability guarantee.
- `1`: The leader writes the message to its local log and responds without waiting for acknowledgment from the followers. This provides better durability than `acks=0` but still has the risk of message loss if the leader fails before the followers have replicated the message.
- `all` or `-1`: The leader waits for the full set of in-sync replicas (ISR) to acknowledge the message before responding to the producer. This provides the highest level of durability and ensures that the message is committed by all in-sync replicas before the write is considered successful.

- B. setting `acks` to `all`, you can ensure that a write is considered successful only when it has been acknowledged by all in-sync replicas, providing the highest level of durability. However, this also introduces additional latency as the producer waits for all acknowledgments.

The choice of the `acks` value depends on the specific requirements of your application regarding durability, latency, and throughput.

</details>

## Question 19

What happens if the `acks` parameter is set to `all` and the minimum in-sync replicas (`min.insync.replicas`) setting is not satisfied?

- A. The producer will retry sending the message until the `min.insync.replicas` requirement is met
- B. The producer will write the message successfully, ignoring the `min.insync.replicas` setting
- C. The producer will receive an error indicating that the `min.insync.replicas` requirement is not met
- D. The producer will wait indefinitely until the `min.insync.replicas` requirement is met

<details>
<summary>Response:</summary> 

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:**
When the `acks` parameter is set to `all` in the Kafka producer configuration, the producer requires acknowledgment from all in-sync replicas (ISR) before considering a write successful. The `min.insync.replicas` setting specifies the minimum number of replicas that must be in-sync for a partition to accept writes.

If the `min.insync.replicas` requirement is not met, meaning there are fewer in-sync replicas than the specified minimum, the producer will receive an error indicating that the write cannot be completed successfully. The error typically indicates that the number of in-sync replicas is insufficient.

In this case, the producer will not retry sending the message automatically. It is the responsibility of the application to handle the error and decide on the appropriate action, such as retrying the write, logging an error, or taking alternative measures.

Setting `min.insync.replicas` to a value greater than 1 in combination with `acks=all` ensures that writes are only considered successful if a minimum number of replicas have acknowledged the message. This provides additional durability guarantees by preventing writes from succeeding if the specified number of replicas is not available.

It's important to note that setting `min.insync.replicas` too high can impact the availability of the system, as writes will fail if the required number of replicas is not available. It's recommended to find a balance between durability and availability based on the specific requirements of your application.

</details>

## Question 20
>
What is the relationship between the `acks` parameter and the `request.required.acks` parameter in Kafka?

- A. They are the same parameter, just with different names
- B. `acks` is used in the producer configuration, while `request.required.acks` is used in the consumer configuration
- C. `acks` is used in the new producer API, while `request.required.acks` is used in the old producer API
- D. They are completely unrelated parameters

<details>
<summary>Response:</summary> 

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:**
The `acks` parameter and the `request.required.acks` parameter in Kafka are related to the acknowledgment mechanism for producer writes, but they are used in different versions of the producer API.

In the new producer API (introduced in Kafka 0.8.2 and later), the `acks` parameter is used to specify the number of acknowledgments the producer requires the leader to have received before considering a write request complete. It is part of the producer configuration.

On the other hand, `request.required.acks` is a parameter used in the old producer API (prior to Kafka 0.8.2). It serves a similar purpose as `acks` but with a slightly different syntax and behavior.

The `request.required.acks` parameter can have the following values:

- `0`: The producer does not wait for any acknowledgment from the server.
- `1`: The leader writes the message to its local log and responds without waiting for acknowledgment from the followers.
- `-1`: The leader waits for the full set of in-sync replicas (ISR) to acknowledge the message before responding to the producer.

In the old producer API, `request.required.acks` is used in the producer configuration to specify the acknowledgment level.

It's important to note that the old producer API and the `request.required.acks` parameter are deprecated and have been replaced by the new producer API and the `acks` parameter. It is recommended to use the new producer API and the `acks` parameter in Kafka versions 0.8.2 and later.

When migrating from the old producer API to the new producer API, you should replace `request.required.acks` with the equivalent `acks` configuration.

## Question 21

How does Kafka's zero-copy optimization handle data transformation or modification?
>CHECK AGAIN

- A. It automatically applies data transformations during the zero-copy process.
- B. It allows custom data transformations to be plugged into the zero-copy mechanism.
- C. It does not support data transformations and sends data as-is.
- D. It performs data transformations after the data is copied into the application's memory.

<details>
<summary>Response:</summary> 

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:**
Kafka's zero-copy optimization is designed to efficiently transfer data between the producer and consumer without any data transformation or modification. When using zero-copy, Kafka sends the data as-is, exactly as it was received from the producer, without applying any transformations.

Here's how Kafka handles data transformation with zero-copy:

1. Producer-side serialization:
    - Before sending data to Kafka, the producer application serializes the data into a format suitable for transmission, such as byte arrays or specific serialization formats like Avro or Protobuf.
    - The producer is responsible for any necessary data transformations or modifications before serialization.

2. Zero-copy data transfer:
    - When the producer sends the serialized data to Kafka, Kafka uses zero-copy optimization to transfer the data directly from the file system cache to the network buffer.
    - During this zero-copy process, Kafka does not perform any data transformations or modifications.
    - The data is sent as-is, exactly as it was received from the producer.

3. Consumer-side deserialization:
    - When the consumer receives the data from Kafka, it needs to deserialize the data from the network format back into the application's format.
    - The consumer is responsible for any necessary data transformations or modifications after deserialization.

Kafka's zero-copy optimization focuses on efficient data transfer and does not include built-in mechanisms for data transformation (option A). It also does not provide a pluggable framework for custom data transformations during the zero-copy process (option B).

If data transformations are required, they should be performed by the producer before sending the data to Kafka and by the consumer after receiving the data from Kafka (option D). This allows the zero-copy optimization to work efficiently by transferring data as-is, without any modifications.

## Question 22

What is the purpose of the `linger.ms` setting in the Kafka producer configuration?

- A. To specify the maximum time to wait for a response from the Kafka broker
- B. To specify the maximum time to wait before sending a batch of messages
- C. To specify the maximum time to wait for a message to be acknowledged by the Kafka broker
- D. To specify the maximum time to wait for a message to be written to the Kafka topic

<details>
<summary>Response:</summary> 

**Explanation:**
The `linger.ms` setting in the Kafka producer configuration is used to specify the maximum time to wait before sending a batch of messages. By default, the Kafka producer sends messages as soon as they are available. However, setting `linger.ms` to a non-zero value allows the producer to wait for a short period of time to accumulate more messages into a batch before sending them to the Kafka broker. This can help improve throughput by reducing the number of requests sent to the broker.

**Answer:** B

</details>

## Question 23

How does the `batch.size` setting affect the behavior of the Kafka producer?

- A. It specifies the maximum number of messages that can be sent in a single batch
- B. It specifies the maximum size (in bytes) of a batch of messages
- C. It specifies the minimum number of messages required to form a batch
- D. It specifies the minimum size (in bytes) of a message to be included in a batch

<details>
<summary>Response:</summary> 

**Explanation:**
The `batch.size` setting in the Kafka producer configuration specifies the maximum size (in bytes) of a batch of messages. When the producer has accumulated messages up to the specified batch size or the `linger.ms` time has elapsed, it sends the batch of messages to the Kafka broker. Increasing the `batch.size` allows the producer to accumulate more messages into a single batch, potentially improving throughput. However, it also increases the memory usage of the producer and may introduce additional latency.

**Answer:** B

</details>

## Question 24
> CHECK AGAIN

What happens if the Kafka producer exhausts its buffer memory while sending messages?

- A. The producer will block and wait until buffer memory becomes available
- B. The producer will start discarding the oldest messages to free up buffer memory
- C. The producer will start discarding the newest messages to free up buffer memory
- D. The producer will throw an exception and stop sending messages

<details>
<summary>Response:</summary> 

**Explanation:**
If the Kafka producer exhausts its buffer memory while sending messages, it will block and wait until buffer memory becomes available. The producer maintains a buffer of messages waiting to be sent to the Kafka broker. If the rate of message production exceeds the rate at which the producer can send messages to the broker, the buffer will start filling up. Once the buffer is full, the producer will block and wait until some buffer memory becomes available. This behavior helps prevent message loss by ensuring that the producer does not discard messages when the buffer is full. However, it can also introduce latency if the producer remains blocked for an extended period.

**Answer:** A

</details>

## Question 25

What is the default value for the `acks` parameter in the Kafka producer configuration?

- A. 0
- B. 1
- C. all
- D. none

<details>
<summary>Response:</summary> 

**Explanation:**
The default value for the `acks` parameter in the Kafka producer configuration is "1". This means that by default, the producer will wait for the leader replica to acknowledge the write before considering the write successful. With `acks=1`, the producer will receive an acknowledgment as soon as the leader replica has written the message to its local log. This provides a balance between durability and performance, as the producer does not wait for the message to be replicated to all followers before receiving an acknowledgment.

**Answer:** B

</details>

## Question 26

What happens when the `acks` parameter is set to "all" in the Kafka producer configuration?

- A. The producer does not wait for any acknowledgment and considers the write successful immediately
- B. The producer waits for the leader replica to acknowledge the write before considering it successful
- C. The producer waits for all in-sync replicas to acknowledge the write before considering it successful
- D. The producer waits for a minimum number of replicas to acknowledge the write before considering it successful

<details>
<summary>Response:</summary> 

**Explanation:**
When the `acks` parameter is set to "all" in the Kafka producer configuration, the producer will wait for all in-sync replicas (ISRs) to acknowledge the write before considering it successful. This means that the producer will receive an acknowledgment only after the message has been successfully written to the leader replica and replicated to all the follower replicas that are currently in-sync. Setting `acks=all` provides the highest level of durability, as it ensures that the message is persisted on multiple replicas before the producer receives an acknowledgment. However, it also introduces additional latency since the producer has to wait for all ISRs to respond.

**Answer:** C

</details>

## Question 27
>
How does the `max.in.flight.requests.per.connection` setting affect the behavior of the Kafka producer when `acks=1`?

- A. It specifies the maximum number of unacknowledged requests allowed per broker connection
- B. It specifies the maximum number of requests that can be sent to the broker concurrently
- C. It specifies the maximum number of messages that can be buffered in the producer's memory
- D. It has no effect when `acks=1`

<details>
<summary>Response:</summary> 

**Explanation:**
The `max.in.flight.requests.per.connection` setting in the Kafka producer configuration specifies the maximum number of unacknowledged requests allowed per broker connection. When `acks=1`, this setting determines how many requests the producer can send to the broker before waiting for an acknowledgment. By default, `max.in.flight.requests.per.connection` is set to 5, meaning the producer can send up to 5 requests to the broker without waiting for an acknowledgment. Increasing this value can potentially improve throughput by allowing more requests to be sent concurrently. However, it also increases the risk of out-of-order delivery if a request fails and needs to be retried, as the subsequent requests may have already been processed.

**Answer:** A

</details>

## Question 28

What is the purpose of the `enable.idempotence` setting in the Kafka producer configuration?

- A. To ensure that messages are delivered exactly once to the Kafka broker
- B. To enable compression of messages sent by the producer
- C. To specify the maximum size of a batch of messages
- D. To control the acknowledgment behavior of the producer

<details>
<summary>Response:</summary> 

**Explanation:**
The `enable.idempotence` setting in the Kafka producer configuration is used to ensure that messages are delivered exactly once to the Kafka broker, even in the presence of network or broker failures. When idempotence is enabled, the producer assigns a unique identifier to each message and maintains a sequence number for each partition. This allows the broker to detect and discard duplicate messages, ensuring that each message is processed exactly once. Enabling idempotence provides a higher level of message delivery reliability, but it may slightly impact the performance of the producer due to the additional bookkeeping and coordination required.

**Answer:** A

</details>

## Question 29

What happens when `max.in.flight.requests.per.connection` is set to 1 and `enable.idempotence` is set to true in the Kafka producer configuration?

- A. The producer will send messages in batches to improve throughput
- B. The producer will wait for each request to be acknowledged before sending the next request
- C. The producer will retry failed requests automatically
- D. The producer will disable message compression

<details>
<summary>Response:</summary> 

**Explanation:**
When `max.in.flight.requests.per.connection` is set to 1 and `enable.idempotence` is set to true in the Kafka producer configuration, the producer will wait for each request to be acknowledged by the broker before sending the next request. This ensures that the producer receives an acknowledgment for each message before proceeding, maintaining the order of messages within each partition. Setting `max.in.flight.requests.per.connection` to 1 in combination with enabling idempotence guarantees that messages are delivered exactly once and in the correct order. However, this configuration may limit the throughput of the producer, as it can only send one request at a time per broker connection.

**Answer:** B

</details>

## Question 30
>
How does enabling idempotence affect the performance of the Kafka producer?

- A. It significantly improves the producer's throughput
- B. It has no impact on the producer's performance
- C. It may slightly reduce the producer's throughput
- D. It increases the producer's memory usage

<details>
<summary>Response:</summary> 

**Explanation:**
Enabling idempotence in the Kafka producer configuration may slightly reduce the producer's throughput compared to a non-idempotent producer. When idempotence is enabled, the producer needs to perform additional bookkeeping and coordination with the Kafka broker to ensure exactly-once message delivery. This includes assigning unique identifiers to messages, maintaining sequence numbers, and handling acknowledgments and retries. The additional overhead introduced by idempotence can result in a slight decrease in the producer's throughput. However, the impact on performance is generally minimal and is often outweighed by the benefits of guaranteed exactly-once delivery, especially in scenarios where message reliability is critical.

**Answer:** C

</details>


## Question 31
>
What does the `acks=all` setting in the Kafka producer configuration ensure?

- A. The producer will receive an acknowledgment only after the message is written to all replicas
- B. The producer will receive an acknowledgment only after the message is written to the leader replica
- C. The producer will receive an acknowledgment only after the message is written to all in-sync replicas
- D. The producer will not wait for any acknowledgment and will consider the write successful immediately

<details>
<summary>Response:</summary> 

**Explanation:**
When the `acks` parameter is set to "all" in the Kafka producer configuration, the producer will receive an acknowledgment only after the message is written to all in-sync replicas (ISRs). In-sync replicas are the replicas that are currently up-to-date with the leader and are considered to have the latest data. Setting `acks=all` ensures the highest level of durability, as the producer will wait for the message to be persisted on multiple replicas before considering the write successful. However, this setting also introduces additional latency, as the producer needs to wait for acknowledgments from all ISRs before proceeding.

**Answer:** C

</details>

## Question 32

What is the purpose of the `client.id` setting in the Kafka producer and consumer configurations?

- A. To specify a unique identifier for the client within a Kafka cluster
- B. To set the maximum number of requests the client can send or receive
- C. To determine the compression type used for message production or consumption
- D. To control the maximum amount of memory the client can use for buffering

<details>
<summary>Response:</summary> 

**Explanation:**
The `client.id` setting in the Kafka producer and consumer configurations is used to specify a unique identifier for the client within a Kafka cluster. It is an optional setting that helps in identifying and tracking the client's activity in the cluster. When set, the `client.id` is included in the metadata of requests sent by the client, making it easier to correlate and monitor client behavior. It can be useful for debugging purposes, as it allows you to identify specific clients in the logs and metrics. The `client.id` does not have any impact on the functional behavior of the client, such as the number of requests, compression type, or memory usage. It is purely used for identification and monitoring purposes.

**Answer:** A

</details>

---

## Question 33
>CHECK AGAIN

What happens if multiple Kafka clients use the same `client.id` value?

- A. The clients will share the same configuration and connection pooling
- B. The clients will be treated as a single logical client by the Kafka brokers
- C. The behavior is undefined, and it may lead to unexpected results or errors
- D. The Kafka brokers will reject the connection attempts from clients with duplicate `client.id`


<details>
<summary>Response:</summary> 

**Explanation:**
If multiple Kafka clients use the same `client.id` value, the behavior is undefined, and it may lead to unexpected results or errors. The `client.id` is meant to be a unique identifier for each client, and Kafka brokers do not enforce uniqueness or perform any special handling when multiple clients have the same `client.id`. Using the same `client.id` for multiple clients can cause confusion and make it difficult to distinguish between the activities of different clients in logs and metrics. It may also lead to incorrect correlation of requests and responses, as the brokers may attribute the actions of one client to another. To avoid these issues, it is recommended to assign a unique `client.id` to each Kafka client in a cluster.

**Answer:** C

</details>

## Question 34

If a producer sends a message with a key to a topic with 5 partitions, which partition will the message be written to?

- A. The partition is randomly selected
- B. The partition is determined based on the hash of the message key
- C. The partition is always the first partition (partition 0)
- D. The partition is determined by the broker

<details>
<summary>Response:</summary> 

**Explanation:**
When a producer sends a message with a key to a topic, the partition to which the message is written is determined based on the hash of the message key. Kafka's default partitioner uses the murmur2 hash function to compute the hash of the key and then maps it to a specific partition.

The process works as follows:
1. The producer calculates the hash of the message key using the murmur2 hash function.
2. The hash value is then modulo'd by the number of partitions in the topic to determine the partition index.
3. The message is sent to the corresponding partition based on the calculated partition index.

This means that messages with the same key will always be sent to the same partition, ensuring that they are processed in the order they were sent.

The partition is not randomly selected, nor is it always the first partition. The broker does not determine the partition for keyed messages; it is determined by the producer based on the hash of the message key.

**Answer:** B

</details>

## Question 35

What happens if a producer sends a message without a key to a topic with 3 partitions?

- A. The message is discarded
- B. The message is sent to a randomly selected partition
- C. The message is sent to all partitions
- D. The message is sent to the partition with the least amount of data

<details>
<summary>Response:</summary> 

**Explanation:**
When a producer sends a message without a key to a topic, the message is sent to a randomly selected partition. In the absence of a key, Kafka's default partitioner uses a round-robin approach to distribute messages evenly across all available partitions.

Here's how it works:
1. The producer maintains an internal counter that keeps track of the last partition it sent a message to.
2. When a message without a key is sent, the producer increments the counter and selects the next partition in a round-robin fashion.
3. The message is sent to the selected partition.
4. The counter is incremented again, and the process repeats for subsequent messages.

This round-robin approach ensures that messages without keys are evenly distributed across all partitions in the topic.

The message is not discarded, sent to all partitions, or sent to the partition with the least amount of data. The partition selection for messages without keys is based on the round-robin algorithm to achieve a balanced distribution.

**Answer:** B

</details>

## Question 36
>CHECK AGAIN

Can a producer guarantee the order of messages within a partition when sending messages with different keys?

- A. Yes, messages within a partition are always guaranteed to be in the same order as they were sent by the producer
- B. No, messages with different keys can be written to the same partition in a different order than they were sent
- C. It depends on the configuration of the producer
- D. It depends on the configuration of the topic

<details>
<summary>Response:</summary> 

**Explanation:**
A producer cannot guarantee the order of messages within a partition when sending messages with different keys. While Kafka guarantees the order of messages within a partition for a given key, it does not guarantee the relative order of messages across different keys.

When a producer sends messages with different keys to the same topic, the messages are partitioned based on the hash of their keys. Messages with the same key will always be sent to the same partition and will be ordered within that partition. However, messages with different keys may be sent to different partitions or even to the same partition but in a different order than they were sent by the producer.

This is because the order of messages in a partition is determined by the order in which they are written to the partition, not by the order in which they were sent by the producer. If messages with different keys are sent to the same partition, their order within that partition depends on the timing and interleaving of the write operations.

The configuration of the producer or the topic does not affect the ordering guarantee for messages with different keys. The order is determined by the partitioning mechanism and the timing of the write operations.

**Answer:** B

## Question 37

What happens when a producer tries to send a message to a partition whose leader replica is not in-sync?

- A. The producer receives a `NotLeaderOrFollowerException` and retries sending the message
- B. The producer waits until the leader replica becomes in-sync before sending the message
- C. The message is automatically routed to another in-sync replica
- D. The producer receives a `LeaderNotAvailableException` and the message is discarded

<details>
<summary>Response:</summary> 

**Explanation:**
When a producer tries to send a message to a partition whose leader replica is not in-sync, the producer will receive a `NotLeaderOrFollowerException`. This exception indicates that the broker the producer is connected to is not the leader for the partition and cannot accept writes.

In this situation, the producer typically retries sending the message after a short backoff period. The producer will attempt to refresh its metadata to obtain the current leader information for the partition. Once the producer has the updated leader information, it will retry sending the message to the new leader.

The producer does not wait indefinitely for the leader replica to become in-sync. It proactively refreshes its metadata and retries sending the message to the updated leader.

The message is not automatically routed to another in-sync replica. The producer specifically sends the message to the partition leader, and it is the leader's responsibility to replicate the message to the followers.

If the producer is unable to send the message after multiple retries, it may eventually timeout or return an error to the application, depending on its configuration. The message is not automatically discarded; it is the application's responsibility to handle the failure and decide whether to retry or discard the message.

**Answer:** A

## Question 38
>
In a topic with a replication factor of 3 and `min.insync.replicas` set to 2, what happens when a producer sends a message with `acks=all` and two replicas are not in-sync?

- A. The producer receives an acknowledgment and the message is successfully written
- B. The producer receives a `NotEnoughReplicasException` and the message is not written
- C. The producer waits indefinitely until at least two replicas become in-sync
- D. The message is written to the leader replica and the producer receives an acknowledgment

<details>
<summary>Response:</summary> 

**Explanation:**
When a topic has a replication factor of 3 and `min.insync.replicas` is set to 2, it means that at least 2 replicas (including the leader) must be in-sync for a write to be considered successful when `acks=all`.

In the scenario where a producer sends a message with `acks=all` and two replicas are not in-sync, the producer will receive a `NotEnoughReplicasException`, and the message will not be written to the topic. The `acks=all` configuration requires acknowledgment from all in-sync replicas before considering a write successful.

Since the topic has `min.insync.replicas` set to 2, the leader replica alone is not sufficient to meet the acknowledgment requirement. The producer will not receive an acknowledgment, and the message will not be written to the topic.

The producer does not wait indefinitely for the replicas to become in-sync. It immediately fails the write operation and returns an exception to the application.

Even though the message may be written to the leader replica, the producer does not receive an acknowledgment because the `acks=all` requirement is not satisfied. The message is not considered successfully written until the required number of in-sync replicas have acknowledged the write.

**Answer:** B

</details>
