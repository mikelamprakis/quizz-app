## Question 36

How does Kafka's zero-copy optimization handle data transformation or modification?

* A. It automatically applies data transformations during the zero-copy process
* B. It allows custom data transformations to be plugged into the zero-copy mechanism
* C. It does not support data transformations and sends data as-is
* D. It performs data transformations after the data is copied into the application's memory

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:**
Kafka’s zero-copy uses the `sendfile` system call to transfer bytes directly from the page cache to the network socket. No transformation is applied during this process—data is passed through as-is, which boosts performance.

## Question 37

What is the purpose of the `linger.ms` setting in the Kafka producer configuration?

* A. To specify the maximum time to wait for a response from the Kafka broker
* B. To specify the maximum time to wait before sending a batch of messages
* C. To specify the maximum time to wait for a message to be acknowledged by the Kafka broker
* D. To specify the maximum time to wait for a message to be written to the Kafka topic

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**
`linger.ms` lets the producer wait for the specified time before sending a batch. This increases chances of batching more messages together, improving throughput, especially when the rate of messages is low.

## Question 38

How does the `batch.size` setting affect the behavior of the Kafka producer?

* A. It specifies the maximum number of messages that can be sent in a single batch
* B. It specifies the maximum size (in bytes) of a batch of messages
* C. It specifies the minimum number of messages required to form a batch
* D. It specifies the minimum size (in bytes) of a message to be included in a batch

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**
`batch.size` determines the upper limit in bytes for a batch of records. Once this threshold is reached or the `linger.ms` timeout expires, the batch is sent to the broker.

## Question 39

What happens if the Kafka producer exhausts its buffer memory while sending messages?

* A. The producer will block and wait until buffer memory becomes available
* B. The producer will start discarding the oldest messages to free up buffer memory
* C. The producer will start discarding the newest messages to free up buffer memory
* D. The producer will throw an exception and stop sending messages

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** A

**Explanation:**
When the buffer is full, the producer will block up to `max.block.ms`. If memory still isn't available, it throws a `TimeoutException`. This behavior prevents dropping data but may slow down producers.

## Question 40

What is the default value for the `acks` parameter in the Kafka producer configuration?

* A. 0
* B. 1
* C. all
* D. none

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**
By default, `acks=1`. This means the leader broker writes the message to its local log and immediately acknowledges it—faster but less durable than `acks=all`.

## Question 41

How does the `max.in.flight.requests.per.connection` setting affect the behavior of the Kafka producer when `acks=1`?

* A. It specifies the maximum number of unacknowledged requests allowed per broker connection
* B. It specifies the maximum number of requests that can be sent to the broker concurrently
* C. It specifies the maximum number of messages that can be buffered in the producer's memory
* D. It has no effect when `acks=1`

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** A

**Explanation:**
The `max.in.flight.requests.per.connection` setting in the Kafka producer configuration specifies the maximum number of unacknowledged requests allowed per broker connection. When `acks=1`, this determines how many requests the producer can send before waiting for an acknowledgment. Higher values improve throughput but may risk message reordering on retries.

## Question 42

What is the purpose of the `enable.idempotence` setting in the Kafka producer configuration?

* A. To ensure that messages are delivered exactly once to the Kafka broker
* B. To enable compression of messages sent by the producer
* C. To specify the maximum size of a batch of messages
* D. To control the acknowledgment behavior of the producer

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** A

**Explanation:**
The `enable.idempotence` setting ensures that messages are delivered exactly once by tracking sequence numbers for each partition. It allows Kafka to discard duplicates caused by retries, making the producer idempotent and improving delivery guarantees.
