## Question 8

**A Kafka topic has a replication factor of 3 and `min.insync.replicas=2`. How many brokers can go down before a producer with `acks=all` can't produce?**

* A. One broker
* B. Two brokers
* C. All brokers can go down
* D. None

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** A

**Explanation:**
With `acks=all` and `min.insync.replicas=2`, at least two replicas must be available. Losing one broker is tolerable, but losing two violates this condition and the producer can no longer send data.

## Question 9

What happens when you set `max.in.flight.requests.per.connection` to a value greater than 1 in a Kafka producer?

* A. It increases the throughput of the producer
* B. It increases the latency of the producer
* C. It can lead to out-of-order delivery of messages
* D. It has no effect on the producer's behavior

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:**
Setting `max.in.flight.requests.per.connection` to a value greater than 1 allows the producer to send multiple requests concurrently without waiting for acknowledgments. This boosts throughput but introduces the risk of message reordering if retries are needed, as later messages may succeed while earlier ones are retried and potentially reordered.

## Question 10

What is the effect of setting `acks=0` in a Kafka producer?

* A. The producer will wait for the broker to acknowledge the message before sending the next one
* B. The producer will wait for the leader and all replicas to acknowledge the message
* C. The producer will not wait for any acknowledgement from the broker
* D. The producer will throw an exception if the broker does not acknowledge the message

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:**
With `acks=0`, the producer sends messages without waiting for any broker acknowledgment. This maximizes throughput but provides no delivery guarantee. The producer cannot detect failures, making this option useful only in use cases where occasional message loss is acceptable.

## Question 11

What is the relationship between `request.timeout.ms` and `delivery.timeout.ms` in a Kafka producer?

* A. `request.timeout.ms` should always be greater than `delivery.timeout.ms`
* B. `delivery.timeout.ms` should always be greater than `request.timeout.ms`
* C. They should always be set to the same value
* D. They are independent and can be set to any value

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**
`request.timeout.ms` defines how long the client waits for a broker response, while `delivery.timeout.ms` is the total time allowed for sending the message before giving up. `delivery.timeout.ms` should be longer to ensure requests aren't aborted prematurely before a broker can respond.

## Question 12

A Kafka producer application needs to send messages to a topic. The messages do not require any particular order. Which of the following properties are mandatory in the producer configuration? (Select two)

* A. `compression.type`
* B. `partitioner.class`
* C. `bootstrap.servers`
* D. `key.serializer`
* E. `value.serializer`
* F. `client.id`

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** C, E

**Explanation:**
`bootstrap.servers` is required to connect to Kafka, and `value.serializer` is required to convert the message value into bytes.

* `key.serializer` is optional if keys arenâ€™t used.
* The rest (`compression.type`, `partitioner.class`, and `client.id`) are optional enhancements.

## Question 13

What is the purpose of setting `compression.type` in a Kafka producer configuration?

* A. To specify the compression algorithm used when sending data to Kafka
* B. To specify the compression algorithm used when storing data on Kafka brokers
* C. To enable or disable compression for the producer
* D. To set the compression level for the producer

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** A

**Explanation:**
`compression.type` controls how the producer compresses data *before* sending it to Kafka. The broker stores the compressed data as-is and the consumer decompresses it on read. The setting defines the algorithm (e.g., `gzip`, `snappy`, `lz4`, `zstd`), not whether compression is enabled/disabled or the level used.

## Question 14

What is the effect of enabling compression on the producer side in Kafka?

* A. Reduced producer memory usage
* B. Increased consumer CPU usage
* C. Reduced network bandwidth usage
* D. Increased end-to-end latency

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:**
Compression reduces the size of data transmitted over the network, decreasing bandwidth usage. However:

* B is also true but not the best answer: consumers must decompress data, increasing their CPU load.
* D is also partially true: compression/decompression adds processing time.
* A is false: compression increases producer memory usage during batching.
