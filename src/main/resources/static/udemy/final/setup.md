You are managing a Kafka cluster that is experiencing periodic slowdowns during high-throughput periods. You suspect that JVM garbage collection might be the cause. How would you adjust the JVM settings to potentially reduce these GC-related slowdowns?

(Select all that apply)

Correct selection
Switch to a low-pause garbage collector like G1GC to reduce disruption during high-throughput periods.

Decrease the heap size to force more frequent garbage collections, ensuring that each collection is quicker.

Your selection is incorrect
Enable real-time garbage collection to prevent any pauses.

Correct selection
Increase the JVM heap size to provide more memory for objects before garbage collection is triggered.

Overall explanation
In this scenario, the periodic slowdowns during high-load periods could be mitigated by:

Increasing the JVM heap size, which can allow more objects to reside in memory before triggering a garbage collection, potentially reducing the frequency of GC events.

Switching to a garbage collector that focuses on minimizing pause times, such as the G1 Garbage Collector (G1GC). G1GC is designed to better support systems requiring large heaps and high-throughput, offering more predictable garbage collection pauses by working concurrently with application threads​​.

How does the publish/subscribe model work specifically in Kafka?

Producers push messages directly to consumers

Your answer is correct
Producers publish messages without knowing the consumers

Consumers push messages directly to producers

Consumers request messages as needed from producers

Overall explanation
In Kafka’s publish/subscribe model, producers publish messages to topics without needing to be aware of the consumers, who subscribe to these topics to receive messages.

A multinational corporation with operations in North America and Europe is implementing a Kafka-based system to handle real-time user interaction data. They are considering an Active/Active replication setup for Kafka. What is a key benefit of this architecture for the corporation?

It simplifies the management of data consistency across geographically dispersed clusters.

It enables automatic data encryption across clusters.

Your answer is correct
It allows for reduced data latency and improved availability by writing to clusters in both regions simultaneously.

It eliminates the need for data backups.

Overall explanation
An Active/Active replication setup in Kafka involves having producers write data to two separate clusters concurrently. For a multinational corporation, this architecture provides the benefit of reduced data latency due to geographic proximity, as users in both North America and Europe can interact with the nearest cluster. Additionally, it enhances system redundancy, ensuring that if one cluster fails (e.g., due to a data center outage), the other can continue operating without interruption, thereby maintaining continuous service availability. However, this setup does not simplify data consistency management and does not eliminate the need for backups, as data still needs to be synchronized and protected against other types of failures.
