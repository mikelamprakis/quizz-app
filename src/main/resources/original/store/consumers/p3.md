## Question 15

What is the purpose of the `isolation.level` configuration in Kafka consumers?

* A. To control the visibility of transactional messages
* B. To specify the maximum number of messages to be read in a single batch
* C. To determine the behavior when a partition is reassigned to another consumer in the group
* D. To set the level of consistency for reading messages from a partition

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** A

**Explanation:**
The `isolation.level` setting controls whether a consumer reads all messages (`read_uncommitted`) or only committed ones (`read_committed`). It's especially relevant when consuming messages produced in transactions.

## Question 16

What happens if you try to call `poll()` on a KafkaConsumer from multiple threads simultaneously?

* A. The consumer will automatically coordinate the threads to process messages in parallel
* B. The consumer will throw a ConcurrentModificationException
* C. The behavior is undefined and may lead to unexpected results or errors
* D. The consumer will process messages sequentially, with each thread taking turns

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:**
KafkaConsumer is not thread-safe. Calling `poll()` concurrently from multiple threads leads to undefined behavior. Always restrict a consumer instance to a single thread or use one consumer per thread.

## Question 17

What is the recommended approach to process messages concurrently using the KafkaConsumer?

* A. Create a single KafkaConsumer instance and share it among multiple threads
* B. Create multiple KafkaConsumer instances, each running in its own thread
* C. Use a thread pool to process messages from a single KafkaConsumer instance
* D. Use a lock or synchronization mechanism to coordinate access to a shared KafkaConsumer instance

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**
The KafkaConsumer is not thread-safe. The recommended approach to achieve concurrent processing is to create multiple KafkaConsumer instances, each running in its own thread. This allows for safe and parallel consumption from different partitions without introducing concurrency bugs. Kafka’s group management ensures each partition is assigned to a single consumer in the group.

## Question 18

How does Kafka ensure that messages are processed in a balanced way when using multiple consumer instances in a consumer group?

* A. Kafka assigns an equal number of messages to each consumer instance
* B. Kafka assigns partitions to consumer instances in a round-robin fashion
* C. Kafka dynamically adjusts the assignment of partitions based on consumer load
* D. Kafka relies on ZooKeeper to distribute messages evenly among consumer instances

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**
Kafka ensures balanced processing by assigning partitions to consumers using a round-robin strategy (or range strategy by default, depending on configuration). Each partition is assigned to only one consumer instance in a group at a time. This results in an even distribution of partitions across consumers, assuming an even number of partitions and consumers.

## Question 19

What is the primary benefit of Kafka's zero-copy optimization when sending data from producers to consumers?

* A. It reduces the memory overhead by avoiding data duplication in memory
* B. It minimizes the latency by eliminating the need for data serialization and deserialization
* C. It improves the security by encrypting the data during transmission
* D. It increases the parallelism by leveraging multiple CPU cores for data transfer

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** A

**Explanation:**
Kafka uses zero-copy optimization to reduce memory overhead by avoiding unnecessary data copying. It leverages the operating system’s `sendfile` syscall to move data directly from the page cache to the network socket without copying it into user-space memory, leading to better performance and throughput.

## Question 20

What is the purpose of the `isolation.level` setting in the Kafka consumer configuration?

* A. To specify the maximum number of records to fetch in a single request
* B. To control the visibility of transactional messages
* C. To determine the behavior of the consumer when it encounters an invalid offset
* D. To set the maximum amount of time the consumer will wait for new messages

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**
The `isolation.level` controls whether the consumer reads only committed transactional messages or all messages. It can be set to:

* `read_uncommitted` (default): read all messages including uncommitted or aborted ones.
* `read_committed`: only read messages that are part of committed transactions, ensuring stronger consistency guarantees.

## Question 21

What is the default value of the `isolation.level` setting in the Kafka consumer configuration?

* A. `read_uncommitted`
* B. `read_committed`
* C. `transactional`
* D. `none`

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** A

**Explanation:**
The default value of `isolation.level` is `read_uncommitted`. This means that, unless explicitly configured otherwise, a Kafka consumer will read all messages including those that may be part of aborted transactions.
