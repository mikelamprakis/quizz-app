## Question 2

```markdown
Kafka is configured with following parameters - log.retention.hours = 168 log.retention.minutes = 168 log.retention.ms = 168  
How long will the messages be retained for?
```

**Options**

```markdown
- A. 168ms
- B. 168 mins
- C. 168 hours
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:**

```markdown
If more than one similar config is specified, the smaller unit size will take precedence.  
Here all three are set to 168, but Kafka will use the largest unit value that makes sense for retention, which is hours in this case.

- A. Incorrect — milliseconds is the smallest unit but 168 ms is very short retention.
- B. Incorrect — minutes would be shorter retention.
- C. Correct — messages will be retained for 168 hours.
```

## Question 4

```markdown
How often is log compaction evaluated?
```

**Options**

```markdown
- A. Every time a message is sent to Kafka
- B. Every time a new partition is created
- C. Every time a segment is closed
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:**

```markdown
Log compaction is evaluated every time a segment is closed. It will be triggered if enough data is "dirty" based on the dirty ratio configuration.

- A. Incorrect — compaction is not evaluated on every message.
- B. Incorrect — partition creation does not trigger compaction.
- C. Correct — compaction is evaluated on segment close.
```
