## Question 22

```markdown
Can a producer configured with `acks=all` and `retries=Integer.MAX_VALUE` ever experience data loss?
```

**Options**

```markdown
- A. No, this configuration guarantees no data loss under all circumstances
- B. Yes, if the total number of replicas for a partition drops below `min.insync.replicas`
- C. Yes, if `unclean.leader.election.enable=true` and all in-sync replicas fail
- D. Yes, if the producer crashes after the broker acknowledges the write but before the producer records the acknowledgment
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** B, C, D

**Explanation:**

```markdown
This configuration offers strong durability, but not perfect guarantees in all failure modes:

- A. False – some rare but real loss scenarios remain.
- B. If replicas drop below `min.insync.replicas`, Kafka rejects writes and data may be lost if retries are exhausted.
- C. If unclean leader election is allowed, a stale replica can become leader, causing message loss.
- D. A producer crash between broker acknowledgment and local acknowledgment tracking can lead to perceived loss.
```

## Question 23

```markdown
You want to produce messages to a Kafka topic using a Java client. Which of the following is NOT a required configuration for the producer?
```

**Options**

```markdown
- A. bootstrap.servers
- B. key.serializer
- C. value.serializer
- D. partitioner.class
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** D

**Explanation:**

```markdown
Kafka producers require `bootstrap.servers`, `key.serializer`, and `value.serializer`.
- A, B, and C are essential.
- D is optional – Kafka uses a default partitioner unless a custom one is specified.
```

## Question 24

```markdown
Which of the following is true about the relationship between producers and consumers in Kafka?
```

**Options**

```markdown
- A. Producers and consumers must use the same serialization format
- B. Producers and consumers must be written in the same programming language
- C. Producers and consumers are decoupled by the Kafka topic
- D. Producers must know about the consumers to send messages to them
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:**

```markdown
Kafka decouples producers and consumers via topics.

- A. False – Kafka supports many serialization formats.
- B. False – Kafka is language-agnostic.
- C. True – Producers and consumers operate independently through topics.
- D. False – Producers don’t know or care about consumers.
```

## Question 25

```markdown
What happens if a Kafka producer sends a message to a topic partition and does not receive an acknowledgment from the broker?
```

**Options**

```markdown
- A. The producer will consider the message as successfully sent
- B. The producer will wait indefinitely for the acknowledgment
- C. The producer will retry sending the message based on its retry configuration
- D. The producer will immediately send the next message in the queue
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:**

```markdown
If the broker doesn’t acknowledge the write, the producer retries based on its configuration:

- A. False – Acknowledgment is required.
- B. False – Producer uses `request.timeout.ms`.
- C. True – Producer retries if `retries > 0`.
- D. False – Retries precede sending the next message.
```

## Question 26

```markdown
What is the purpose of the `acks` parameter in Kafka producer configuration?
```

**Options**

```markdown
- A. To specify the number of partitions the producer should write to
- B. To specify the number of replicas that must acknowledge a write for it to be considered successful
- C. To specify the number of times the producer should retry sending a message
- D. To specify the maximum size of a batch of messages
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**

```markdown
`acks` controls how many broker acknowledgments are needed for a write to succeed:

- A. False – unrelated to partitions.
- B. True – defines durability level.
- C. False – that’s `retries`.
- D. False – that’s `batch.size`.
```

## Question 27

```markdown
What happens if the `acks` parameter is set to `all` and the minimum in-sync replicas (`min.insync.replicas`) setting is not satisfied?
```

**Options**

```markdown
- A. The producer will retry sending the message until the `min.insync.replicas` requirement is met
- B. The producer will write the message successfully, ignoring the `min.insync.replicas` setting
- C. The producer will receive an error indicating that the `min.insync.replicas` requirement is not met
- D. The producer will wait indefinitely until the `min.insync.replicas` requirement is met
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:**

```markdown
When `acks=all`, if in-sync replicas < `min.insync.replicas`, the broker rejects the write:

- A. False – producer does not retry endlessly.
- B. False – it respects this constraint.
- C. True – error is returned.
- D. False – the producer will timeout or error.
```

## Question 28

```markdown
What is the relationship between the `acks` parameter and the `request.required.acks` parameter in Kafka?
```

**Options**

```markdown
- A. They are the same parameter, just with different names
- B. `acks` is used in the producer configuration, while `request.required.acks` is used in the consumer configuration
- C. `acks` is used in the new producer API, while `request.required.acks` is used in the old producer API
- D. They are completely unrelated parameters
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:**

```markdown
`acks` and `request.required.acks` serve the same purpose:

- A. Not quite – naming reflects API version.
- B. False – both are producer configs.
- C. True – `acks` is for the new producer API; `request.required.acks` was used in the legacy one.
- D. False – they are related.
```
