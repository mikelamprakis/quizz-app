## Question 8

```markdown
A Kafka producer is configured to use the `acks=all` setting while publishing messages to a topic partition that has a replication factor of 3. The topic is also configured with `min.insync.replicas=2`. Broker A hosts the current leader for this partition, while Brokers B and C host the replicas. Due to unforeseen circumstances, both Broker B and Broker C go offline simultaneously. What is the impact on the producer's ability to successfully publish messages to this partition?

```

**Options**

```markdown
- A. The producer will be able to publish messages, but with potential data loss.
- B. The producer will temporarily be unable to publish messages until at least one replica broker comes back online.
- C. The producer will continue to publish messages successfully without any impact.
- D. The producer will immediately switch to another topic's partition that has all replicas available.
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**

```markdown
With `acks=all` and `min.insync.replicas=2`, the producer needs acknowledgments from the leader plus at least one ISR replica. If both replicas go offline, ISR count drops below 2, so the producer cannot publish until a replica rejoins.

- A. False — no publishing possible, not just data loss.
- B. Correct — producer blocks until ISR recovers.
- C. False — publishing is impacted.
- D. False — producer doesn't switch partitions automatically.
```

## Question 10

```markdown
A Kafka cluster has the following configuration:

`unclean.leader.election.enable=false`

What is the implication of this setting when a partition leader fails and there are no in-sync replicas (ISRs) available?
```

**Options**

```markdown
- A. The partition will remain unavailable until the failed leader recovers.
- B. The partition will elect a new leader from the out-of-sync replicas to maintain availability.
- C. The partition will automatically create a new replica to replace the failed leader.
- D. The partition will be reassigned to another broker in the cluster.
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** A

**Explanation:**

```markdown
When `unclean.leader.election.enable=false`, Kafka disallows election of a leader from out-of-sync replicas.  
So if no ISR is available after leader failure, the partition remains unavailable to preserve data consistency.

- A. Correct — partition remains unavailable until original leader recovers.
- B. Incorrect — election from out-of-sync replicas is disabled.
- C. Incorrect — Kafka does not create replicas automatically.
- D. Incorrect — partition is not reassigned automatically.
```

## Question 12

```markdown
A Kafka cluster is configured with:

`default.replication.factor=2`  
`min.insync.replicas=2`

What is the minimum number of brokers required to tolerate one failure and still serve write requests?
```

**Options**

```markdown
- A. 1
- B. 2
- C. 3
- D. 4
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:**

```markdown
`min.insync.replicas=2` means two replicas must acknowledge writes.  
To tolerate one broker failure while maintaining two in-sync replicas, you need **3 brokers** in total.

- A. Incorrect — one broker cannot meet insync requirements.
- B. Incorrect — two brokers cannot tolerate one failure and still maintain 2 ISRs.
- C. Correct — three brokers allow one failure and 2 ISRs remain.
- D. Incorrect — more than needed.
```

## Question 17

```markdown
Which of the following statements about `acks` and `min.insync.replicas` are true? (Select all that apply)
```

**Options**

```markdown
- A. `acks` is a producer configuration, while `min.insync.replicas` is a topic configuration
- B. `acks` and `min.insync.replicas` are both producer configurations
- C. `acks` and `min.insync.replicas` are both topic configurations
- D. `acks=all` and `min.insync.replicas=1` provides the strongest durability guarantee
- E. `acks=1` and `min.insync.replicas=2` provides the strongest durability guarantee
- F. For `acks=all` to provide any additional durability over `acks=1`, `min.insync.replicas` must be greater than 1
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** A, F

**Explanation:**

```markdown
- A. Correct: `acks` is a producer config; `min.insync.replicas` is a topic config.
- F. Correct: `acks=all` only provides better durability than `acks=1` if `min.insync.replicas > 1`.
- B, C. Incorrect, they are configs at different levels.
- D. Incorrect, with `min.insync.replicas=1`, `acks=all` is no stronger than `acks=1`.
- E. Incorrect, this combination does not provide the strongest durability.
```

## Question 18

```markdown
In a Kafka cluster, you have a topic with 6 partitions and a replication factor of 3. How many replicas of each partition will be spread across the brokers?
```

**Options**

```markdown
- A. 1 replica per broker
- B. 2 replicas per broker
- C. 3 replicas per broker
- D. 6 replicas per broker
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:**

```markdown
Each partition has 3 replicas:

- 1 leader + 2 followers.
- For 6 partitions × 3 replicas = 18 replicas total.
- These are spread across brokers for redundancy.

Kafka ensures load balancing but the number of replicas per broker depends on the cluster size.
```

## Question 19

```markdown
In a Kafka cluster, you have a topic with 6 partitions and a replication factor of 3. How many replicas of each partition will be spread across the brokers?

- A. 1 replica per broker
- B. 2 replicas per broker
- C. 3 replicas per broker
- D. 6 replicas per broker
```

**Options**

```markdown
- A. 1 replica per broker
- B. 2 replicas per broker
- C. 3 replicas per broker
- D. 6 replicas per broker
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary> 

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:**

```markdown
Each partition has 3 replicas:

- A. 1 replica per broker – ❌ Not accurate for replication factor 3.
- B. 2 replicas per broker – ❌ Underreplicated.
- C. 3 replicas per broker – ✅ Each of the 6 partitions has 3 replicas (18 total).
- D. 6 replicas per broker – ❌ Misrepresents Kafka's replication mechanism.
```

## Question 13

```markdown
What is true about partitions? (select two)
```

**Options**

```markdown
- A. A partition has a one replica that is leader, while the others replicas are follower.
- B. A broker can have the differnt partition for the same topic on its disk
- C. A broker can have the partition and the replica of topic on its disk
- D. You can not have more partition than the no of broker in your cluster.
```

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** A, B

**Explanation:**

```markdown
- A. Only one of the replicas is elected as partition leader.
- B. A broker can definitely hold many partitions from the same topic on its disk, e.g., a topic with 12 partitions on one broker.
- C. Incorrect, a broker holds either the leader or a replica of a partition but not both at the same time.
- D. Incorrect, you can have more partitions than brokers.
```
