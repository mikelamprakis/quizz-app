## Question 1

Which tool is commonly used to monitor Kafka cluster health and performance?

- A. Nagios
- B. Prometheus
- C. Elasticsearch
- D. Splunk

<details>
<summary>Response:</summary> 

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**
Prometheus is widely used for monitoring Kafka cluster health and performance. It collects metrics from Kafka brokers, producers, and consumers, and stores them in a time-series database. Prometheus can be used with Grafana for visualizing these metrics.

- A, C, and D are incorrect because while Nagios, Elasticsearch, and Splunk can be used for monitoring and logging, Prometheus is more specialized for metrics collection and monitoring.

</details>

## Question 2

What is the primary purpose of JMX in the context of Kafka monitoring?

- A. To configure Kafka brokers
- B. To provide real-time logging of Kafka events
- C. To expose Kafka metrics for monitoring
- D. To manage Kafka ACLs

<details>
<summary>Response:</summary> 

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:**
JMX (Java Management Extensions) is used to expose Kafka metrics for monitoring. Kafka brokers expose various metrics (such as broker metrics, topic metrics, and consumer group metrics) through JMX, which can be collected and monitored by tools like Prometheus.

- A is incorrect because JMX is not used for configuring Kafka brokers. B is incorrect because JMX is not primarily used for real-time logging. D is incorrect because JMX does not manage Kafka ACLs.

</details>

## Question 3

Which Kafka metric would you monitor to detect message delivery delays in a Kafka cluster?

- A. `MessagesInPerSec`
- B. `RequestLatencyMs`
- C. `UnderReplicatedPartitions`
- D. `BytesOutPerSec`

<details>
<summary>Response:</summary> 

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**
`RequestLatencyMs` is the Kafka metric that indicates the latency of requests. Monitoring this metric can help detect message delivery delays in a Kafka cluster.

- A, C, and D are incorrect because they measure different aspects: `MessagesInPerSec` measures the rate of messages being produced, `UnderReplicatedPartitions` indicates partition replication issues, and `BytesOutPerSec` measures the rate of bytes being consumed.

## Question 21

How can the `client.id` setting be useful in monitoring and troubleshooting Kafka clients?

- A. It allows setting different configuration parameters for each client
- B. It enables tracking and correlating client activity in logs and metrics
- C. It determines the partitioning strategy used by the client
- D. It specifies the maximum number of connections the client can establish

<details>
<summary>Response:</summary> 

**Explanation:**

The `client.id` setting can be useful in monitoring and troubleshooting Kafka clients by enabling tracking and correlating client activity in logs and metrics. When the `client.id` is set to a unique value for each client, it becomes easier to identify and trace the behavior of individual clients within a Kafka cluster. Kafka brokers include the `client.id` in the metadata of requests received from the clients, allowing you to associate specific requests and activities with particular clients. This information is valuable for debugging and performance analysis. By examining the logs and metrics with the `client.id`, you can isolate issues, track message flow, and understand the behavior of specific clients, facilitating effective troubleshooting and monitoring.

**Answer:** B
