## Question 22

Can a producer configured with `acks=all` and `retries=Integer.MAX_VALUE` ever experience data loss?

* A. No, this configuration guarantees no data loss under all circumstances
* B. Yes, if the total number of replicas for a partition drops below `min.insync.replicas`
* C. Yes, if `unclean.leader.election.enable=true` and all in-sync replicas fail
* D. Yes, if the producer crashes after the broker acknowledges the write but before the producer records the acknowledgment

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** B, C, D

**Explanation:**
This configuration offers strong durability, but not perfect guarantees in all failure modes:

* **B:** If replicas drop below `min.insync.replicas`, Kafka rejects writes and data may be lost if retries are exhausted.

* **C:** If unclean leader election is allowed, a stale replica can become leader, causing message loss.

* **D:** A producer crash between broker acknowledgment and local acknowledgment tracking can lead to perceived loss.

* A is false; some rare but real loss scenarios remain.

## Question 23

You want to produce messages to a Kafka topic using a Java client. Which of the following is NOT a required configuration for the producer?

* A. `bootstrap.servers`
* B. `key.serializer`
* C. `value.serializer`
* D. `partitioner.class`

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** D

**Explanation:**
Kafka producers require `bootstrap.servers`, `key.serializer`, and `value.serializer`.
The `partitioner.class` is optional—Kafka uses a default partitioner unless a custom one is specified.

## Question 24

Which of the following is true about the relationship between producers and consumers in Kafka?

* A. Producers and consumers must use the same serialization format
* B. Producers and consumers must be written in the same programming language
* C. Producers and consumers are decoupled by the Kafka topic
* D. Producers must know about the consumers to send messages to them

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:**
Kafka decouples producers and consumers via topics. Producers publish messages to topics, and consumers subscribe independently.

* A and B are wrong—Kafka is language-agnostic and format-flexible.
* D is incorrect—producers don’t need to know about consumers.

## Question 25

What happens if a Kafka producer sends a message to a topic partition and does not receive an acknowledgment from the broker?

* A. The producer will consider the message as successfully sent
* B. The producer will wait indefinitely for the acknowledgment
* C. The producer will retry sending the message based on its retry configuration
* D. The producer will immediately send the next message in the queue

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:**
If the broker doesn’t acknowledge the write, the producer follows the retry policy. If retries are configured (`retries > 0`), the message will be retried.

* A is incorrect: messages must be acknowledged.
* B is wrong: the producer times out (`request.timeout.ms`).
* D is incorrect: retries happen before the next message is sent.

## Question 26

What is the purpose of the `acks` parameter in Kafka producer configuration?

* A. To specify the number of partitions the producer should write to
* B. To specify the number of replicas that must acknowledge a write for it to be considered successful
* C. To specify the number of times the producer should retry sending a message
* D. To specify the maximum size of a batch of messages

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**
`acks` determines how many acknowledgments the broker must receive before the producer considers a message successfully written:

* `acks=0`: no acknowledgment required

* `acks=1`: leader only

* `acks=all`: all in-sync replicas

* A, C, and D are unrelated to this specific durability parameter.

</details>

## Question 27

What happens if the `acks` parameter is set to `all` and the minimum in-sync replicas (`min.insync.replicas`) setting is not satisfied?

* A. The producer will retry sending the message until the `min.insync.replicas` requirement is met
* B. The producer will write the message successfully, ignoring the `min.insync.replicas` setting
* C. The producer will receive an error indicating that the `min.insync.replicas` requirement is not met
* D. The producer will wait indefinitely until the `min.insync.replicas` requirement is met

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:**
If `acks=all` and the number of in-sync replicas is less than the `min.insync.replicas` value, the broker will reject the write. The producer will receive an error. It will not retry by default—retry logic is up to the application. This setting ensures higher durability by enforcing a minimum number of replicas for successful writes.

## Question 28

What is the relationship between the `acks` parameter and the `request.required.acks` parameter in Kafka?

* A. They are the same parameter, just with different names
* B. `acks` is used in the producer configuration, while `request.required.acks` is used in the consumer configuration
* C. `acks` is used in the new producer API, while `request.required.acks` is used in the old producer API
* D. They are completely unrelated parameters

<details><summary>Response:</summary>

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:**
`acks` is the configuration used in the new Kafka producer API (0.8.2+), whereas `request.required.acks` was its equivalent in the old producer API. Both control how many acknowledgments the producer requires from the broker, but `request.required.acks` is now deprecated.
